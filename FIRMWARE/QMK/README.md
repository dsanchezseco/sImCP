## See https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/dsanchezseco/sImCP for more info and code

This version of the firmware works as a keyboard using [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) and it is recognized as such.
To prevent the conflict with default game bindings it makes an extensive use of modifiers (right/left shift, alt and control).

The file can be found on the `READY TO USE FILES/FIRMWARE` folder with the name `dsanchezseco_sImCP_default.hex`

## DCS 
It works w/o problem, maybe some default keybinds collisions. DCS is slow reading the keypresses on the binding assignment page, so several presses might be required to get both the modifiers and the key. It works perfectly later on the cockpit

## Falcon BMS
Falcon BMS doesn't distingish between left and right modifiers, but this shouldn't be a problem as there are no repeated keys being used. Not tested (yet) tho.

## Others

Untested. Feel free to tell me with your findings
